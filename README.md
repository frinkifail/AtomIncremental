# Atom Incremental
Ah yes, another Distance Incremental copy

Ok I just realized there's a game similar to this called Elemental Incremental which I literally just found [@SuperSpruce/Elemental-Incremental](https://github.comx/SuperSpruce/Elemental-Incremental)

Inspired by my old game Command Incremental which is inspired by Points Incremental (Factory Idle ([@melk12345/Factory-Idle](https://github.com/melk12345/Factory-Idle))) which is inspired by Particle Incremental ([@XnoobSpeakable/Particle-Incremental](https://github.com/XnoobSpeakable/Particle-Incremental)) which is inspired by other incremental games :)

## Features
### Atoms
You got uhh

hmm

I forgot all of the elements tbh

So here's a list for now:
- Oxygen
- Hydrogen
- Helium
- Phosphor

The order of elements is the order I came up with
