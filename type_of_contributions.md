# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to the Atom Incremental content and site in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on frinkifail.github.io/AtomIncremental! Our small, but mighty :muscle: development team (only me) is maintaining this repo; to preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a contents PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs (not yet) <!-- remove when i finally add!! -->, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/frinkifail/AtomIncremental/discussions).

### :lady_beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or the website that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository. When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa:

### :question: Support
We are a small team (only me) working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with your browser, unrelated to our game, please search Google since we can't afford to help. Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to search Google, then closed and locked.

If you're having trouble with the game, please just cry about it *(I'm joking)*.
